============

LaTeX templates for grant proposals to the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/German Research Foundation).


Features
--------

* English and German versions of [DFG form 53.01](http://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_01_elan/) (project proposal).
* English and German versions of [DFG form 53.02](http://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_02_elan/) (research unit coordination proposal).
* English and German versions of [DFG form 53.20](http://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_20_elan/) (research unit draft proposal).
* English and German versions of [DFG form 53.200](http://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_200_elan/) (curriculum vitae).
* A page layout that closely matches the rich text documents provided by the DFG.

  * *position* for single objects.
  * *positionmul* for multiples.


Successful applications
-----------------------

These templates were used to apply for the following projects:

* Lamb wave modes repulsion in multi-layered structures ([449607253](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/449607253))
* FOR 5208: Model-based determination of nonlinear properties of piezoceramics for high-power ultrasound applications ([444955436](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/444955436))
* Determination of all acoustic material parameters of polymers II ([409779252](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/409779252))
