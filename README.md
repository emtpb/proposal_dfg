============

A LaTeX template for grant proposals to the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, German Research Foundation).


Features
--------
 
* English and German versions of the [DFG form 53.01](http://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_01_elan/).
* English and German versions of the [DFG form 53.02](http://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_02_elan/).
* English and German versions of the [DFG form 53.20](http://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_20_elan/).
* An environment *funds* that can be used to automatically sum up all costs specified using the following macros:
  * *position* for single objects.
  * *positionmul* for multiples.
* Many useful packages already imported, such as: 
  * *tikz* and *pgfplots* for graphics and plots. 
  * *siunitx* for correct unit formatting. 
  * *pgfgant* for Gantt charts/schedules.


Successful applications
-----------------------

This template was used to apply for the following projects:

* A model-based measurement procedure for the characterization of frequency-dependent material properties of piezoceramics using a singleton specimen ([321120716](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/321120716))
* Lamb wave modes repulsion in multi-layered structures ([449607253](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/449607253))
* Model-based determination of nonlinear properties of piezoceramics for high-power ultrasound applications ([444955436](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/444955436))
* Determination of all acoustic material parameters of polymers ([409779252](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/409779252))
