A LaTeX template for grant proposals to the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, German Research Foundation).


Features
--------
 
* English and German versions of the [DFG form 53.10](http://www.dfg.de/foerderung/programme/einzelfoerderung/sachbeihilfe/formulare_merkblaetter/index.jsp).
* An automatically generated header.
* An environment *funds* that can be used to automatically sum up all costs specified using the following macros:
	+ *position* for single objects.
	+ *positionmul* for multiples.
* Many useful packages already imported, such as: 
	+ *tikz* and *pgfplots* for graphics and plots. 
	+ *siunitx* for correct unit formatting. 
	+ *pgfgant* for Gantt charts/schedules.


Disclaimer
----------

As of now, no proposal has been submitted to the DFG using this template. Therefore we do not yet know if the formatting, although made to match the original rich text template, will be accepted by the officials.
